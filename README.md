Description

This project is a simple HTML landing page created to practice core web development fundamentals. 
The focus is on understanding basic HTML structure, semantic elements, and proper nesting.


What I Learned

- How HTML provides the structural foundation of a website
- The importance of semantic HTML elements for clarity and accessibility
- How nesting elements creates organized and readable page structure
- How browsers interpret HTML in a strict, top-down manner


How It Works

The page uses a main heading to represent the primary title, a paragraph to display content text, 
and a link element to demonstrate navigation. All elements are written using semantic HTML.


Future Improvements

- Add CSS styling for layout and visual design
- Improve accessibility and responsiveness
- Add basic interactivity using JavaScript
